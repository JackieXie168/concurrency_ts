<H1>Improvements to the Concurrency Technical Specification, revision 1</H1>

  <h1>Motivation and Goals</h1>
<p>
This document proposes improvements to <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4107.html">N4107</a>,
the current Working Draft of the Concurrency TS.
</p>
<p>
This document is a revision of 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4123.html">N4123</a>,
which was presented to SG1 and LEWG at the Urbana meeting.
</p>
<p>
This document is motivated by <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4032.html">N4032</a>
and <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4048.pdf">N4048</a>,
which were presented to SG1 at the Rapperswil meeting. This document collects the parts of these papers that
received positive feedback from SG1 and presents them as a combined set of proposed changes to
the Concurrency TS.
</p>
<p>
The paper also addresses numerous issues discovered and reported
to the author by various individuals, namely Agust&iacute;n Berg&eacute;, 
Vicente J. Botet Escriba, Hartmut Kaiser and Anthony Williams.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the changes proposed in N4123, this document implements the 
following suggestions from SG1 and LEWG received at the Urbana meeting:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Do not introduce <code>std::experimental::async</code> function. This avoids
    having to specify execution policies. This also
    avoids the question of whether a <code>future</code> created by 
    <code>async</code> should block in the destructor.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove <code>when_any_back</code>, and change the return type of 
    <code>when_any</code> to return the sequence of <code>future</code>s 
    as well as the index of the ready <code>future</code>.
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
Finally, the paper implements a small fix to the signature of <code>make_ready_future</code>
to support <code>reference_wrapper</code> types. This fix was 
<a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/concurrency_ts/issues/68">requested</a>
during the Urbana meeting but was <u>not</u> reviewed by SG1 or LEWG.
</p>
<p>
The author seeks feedback from LWG on this document. If approved by LWG, the changes 
proposed in this document will be incorporated into the next 
Working Paper of the Concurrency TS.

      <li><ins>

    <p><ins>This section describes tentative plans for future versions of

    future versions of the C++ Standard.</ins></p>

    <p><ins>The C++ committee intends to release a new version of this
    technical specification approximately every year, containing the
    library extensions we hope to add to a near-future version of the
    C++ Standard.  Future versions will define their contents in
    <code>std::experimental::concurrency_v2</code>,
    <code>std::experimental::concurrency_v3</code>, etc., with the
    most recent implemented version inlined into
    <code>std::experimental</code>.</ins></p>

    <p><ins>When an extension defined in this or a future version of this
    technical specification represents enough existing practice, it
    will be moved into the next version of the C++ Standard by
    removing the <code>experimental::concurrency_v<var>N</var></code>
    segment of its namespace and by removing the
    <code>experimental/</code> prefix from its header's path.</ins></p>

    <h1><ins>Feature-testing recommendations (Informative)</ins></h1>

    <p><ins>
      For the sake of improved portability between partial implementations of various C++ standards,
      WG21 (the ISO technical committee for the C++ programming language) recommends
      that implementers and programmers follow the guidelines in this section concerning feature-test macros.
      <cxx-note><a href="http://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-6-sg10-feature-test-recommendations">WG21's SD-6</a> makes similar recommendations for the C++ Standard itself.</cxx-note>
    </ins></p>

    <p><ins>
      Implementers who provide a new standard feature should define a macro with the recommended name,
      in the same circumstances under which the feature is available (for example, taking into account relevant command-line options),
      to indicate the presence of support for that feature.
      Implementers should define that macro with the value specified in
      the most recent version of this technical specification that they have implemented.
      The recommended macro name is "<code>__cpp_lib_experimental_</code>" followed by the string in the "Macro Name Suffix" column.
    </ins></p>

    <p><ins>
      Programmers who wish to determine whether a feature is available in an implementation should base that determination on
      the presence of the header (determined with <code>__has_include(&lt;header/name>)</code>) and
      the state of the macro with the recommended name.
      (The absence of a tested feature may result in a program with decreased functionality, or the relevant functionality may be provided in a different way.
      A program that strictly depends on support for a feature can just try to use the feature unconditionally;
      presumably, on an implementation lacking necessary support, translation will fail.)
