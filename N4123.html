<H1>Improvements to the Concurrency Technical Specification</H1>

  <h1>Motivation and Goals</h1>
<p>
This document proposes improvements to <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4107.html">N4107</a>,
the current Working Draft of the Concurrency TS.
</p>
<p>
The document is motivated by <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4032.html">N4032</a>
and <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4048.pdf">N4048</a>,
which were presented to SG1 at the Rapperswil meeting. This document collects the parts of these papers that
received positive feedback from SG1 and presents them as a combined set of proposed changes to
the Concurrency TS.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the paper also addresses some of the issues discovered and reported
to the editor by various individuals, primarily Vicente J. Botet Escriba and Anthony Williams.
</p>
<p>
The author seeks feedback from SG1 on this document. If directed by SG1, all or
some the changes proposed in this document will be incorporated into the next 
Working Paper of the Concurrency TS.

    <p>Since the extensions described in this technical specification
    are experimental and not part of the C++ standard library, they
    should not be declared directly within namespace
    <code>std</code>.
    Unless otherwise specified, all components described in this technical specification either:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>modify an existing interface in the C++ Standard Library in-place,</li>
      <li>
        are declared in a namespace whose name appends <code>::experimental::concurrent_v1</code>
        to a namespace defined in the C++ Standard Library,
        such as <code>std</code>, or
      </li>
      <li>
        are declared in a subnamespace of a namespace described in the previous bullet,
        whose name is not the same as an existing subnamespace of namespace <code>std</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each header described in this technical
    specification shall import the contents of
    <code>std::experimental::concurrent_v1</code> into
    <code>std::experimental</code> as if by</p>

    <pre><code>namespace std {
  namespace experimental {
    inline namespace concurrent_v1 {}
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p>Unless otherwise specified, references to other entities
    described in this technical specification are assumed to be
    qualified with <code>std::experimental::concurrent_v1::</code>,
    and references to entities described in the standard are assumed
    to be qualified with <code>std::</code>.</p>

    <p>Extensions that are expected to eventually be added to an
    existing header <code>&lt;meow></code> are provided inside the
    <code>&lt;experimental/meow></code> header, which shall include
    the standard contents of <code>&lt;meow></code> as if by</p>
    <pre><code>#include &lt;meow></code></pre>

    <p>New headers are also provided in the
    <code>&lt;experimental/></code> directory, but without such an
    <code>#include</code>.</p>

<ins>
    <p>This section describes tentative plans for future versions of
    this technical specification and plans for moving content into
    future versions of the C++ Standard.</p>

    <p>The C++ committee intends to release a new version of this
    technical specification approximately every year, containing the
    library extensions we hope to add to a near-future version of the
    C++ Standard.  Future versions will define their contents in
    <code>std::experimental::concurrent_v2</code>,
    <code>std::experimental::concurrent_v3</code>, etc., with the
    most recent implemented version inlined into
    <code>std::experimental</code>.</p>

    <p>When an extension defined in this or a future version of this
    technical specification represents enough existing practice, it
    will be moved into the next version of the C++ Standard by
    removing the <code>experimental::concurrent_v<var>N</var></code>
    segment of its namespace and by removing the
    <code>experimental/</code> prefix from its header's path.</p>

    <h1><ins>Feature-testing recommendations (Informative)</ins></h1>
<ins>
    <cxx-ednote>
      These feature-testing macros are my invention, with very little input from anyone else.
      I've tried to be consistent with the SD-6 recommendations and
      divide features where I suspect they may be implemented at different times despite being added by the same paper.
      I'll be happy to accept changes to this section as editorial fixes until the PDTS is published.
    </cxx-ednote>

    <p>
      For the sake of improved portability between partial implementations of various C++ standards,
      WG21 (the ISO technical committee for the C++ programming language) recommends
      that implementers and programmers follow the guidelines in this section concerning feature-test macros.
      <cxx-note><a href="http://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-6-sg10-feature-test-recommendations">WG21's SD-6</a> makes similar recommendations for the C++ Standard itself.</cxx-note>
    </p>

    <p>
      Implementers who provide a new standard feature should define a macro with the recommended name,
      in the same circumstances under which the feature is available (for example, taking into account relevant command-line options),
      to indicate the presence of support for that feature.
      Implementers should define that macro with the value specified in
      the most recent version of this technical specification that they have implemented.
      The recommended macro name is "<code>__cpp_lib_experimental_</code>" followed by the string in the "Macro Name Suffix" column.
    </p>

    <p>
      Programmers who wish to determine whether a feature is available in an implementation should base that determination on
      the presence of the header (determined with <code>__has_include(&lt;header/name>)</code>) and
      the state of the macro with the recommended name.
      (The absence of a tested feature may result in a program with decreased functionality, or the relevant functionality may be provided in a different way.
      A program that strictly depends on support for a feature can just try to use the feature unconditionally;
      presumably, on an implementation lacking necessary support, translation will fail.)
